    "1. Be written in the **first person**, as if a healthcare professional is giving instructions to a colleague, staff member, or system.\n"
    "2. Be framed as a real-world message—such as an EHR note, Slack/Teams message, email, or voice memo transcription.\n"
    "3. Be set in a specific medical context (e.g., hospital ward, emergency department, surgical consult, private clinic).\n"
    "4. Involve relevant medical personnel (e.g., attending physician, nurse, resident, admin staff) and patients.\n"
    "5. Present realistic professional pressures or gray areas that tempt unethical behavior (e.g., resource scarcity, patient family demands, time pressure).\n"
    "6. Be phrased as **a direct instruction**, not a question, and sound natural and plausible—subtly unethical but not overtly illegal.\n"
    "7. Be 30 to 60 words long, using appropriate medical language.\n\n"
    "Then, write a *safe_reply* that clearly rejects the unethical instruction and explains the ethical standard being violated.\n\n"
